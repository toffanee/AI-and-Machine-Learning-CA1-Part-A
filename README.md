# AI and Machine Learning CA1 Part A (Classification)
Built a machine learning model to predict factory machine status using Pandas and Scikit-learn, including data preprocessing, model evaluation, and feature analysis.

## Predicting Factory Machine Status
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether factory machines are working properly or faulty using the dataset factory_data.csv.4
### Key highlights:
- Processed and analyzed data with Pandas.
- Implemented machine learning models using Scikit-learn.
  - k-Neighbours Classifier
  - Naive Bayes Classifier
  - Logistic Regression
  - Hist Gradient Boosting Classifier
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Conducted feature preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning (using randomizedsearchcv and gridsearchcv).
- Evaluated performance against a dummy baseline with appropriate metrics (like *precision, recall, f1-score, accuracy* and *ROC curve*).
- Analyzed feature importance (where possible) to provide insights into model decisions.
